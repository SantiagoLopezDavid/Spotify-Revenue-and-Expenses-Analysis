Throughout the years, `Total Costs` and `Total Revenue` have been very close. At the end of the year 2017, `Total Revenue` had a substancial difference from `Total Costs`, and although this means bigger `Gross Profits` for **Spotify** they could not maintain that difference. In the years **2020** and **2022**, `Total Costs` where bigger than `Total Revenue`. The year **2022** would have been the worst in terms of `Gross Profit` due to this big difference.

`Gross Profit` has been increasing during the past 7 years. But although this shows 'growth', `Net profit` would be more representative measure of how well **Spotify** is doing.

**3. Net Profit**

It is clear that `Net Profit` is not a steady measure. It has a lot of drastic changes during the years and is mostly negative with the lowest point at -231 Millions of Euro during the year 2022 and the highest at 213 Millions of Euro during the year 2017. This leaves a lot of questions about the profitability of Spotify as a business. It might seem that `Total Revenue` and `Gross Profit` has a steady growth but so does the `Total Costs` of the company. This behaviour might be the reason why `Net Profit` is not what we expected.

This graph shows the difference from every quarter to the previous for all 7 years. It is a very interesting graph because it showcase the fluctation of `Net Profit`. This can help us have a better idea of how is the company behaviour and growth.

As shown in the graphic, we see that the best year in terms of growth was **2017**. Althought they had negative `Net Profit` they still manage to improve in each **Quarter** and finish their **Q4** with the best `Net Profit` of all 7 years. From here is very clear that **Spotify** has a hard time gaining momentum and maintaining improvement from quarter to quarter. There is not a single year from **2017** in which the company has a positive difference in more than two consecutives quarters. The worst year for the company, as we have seen in previous graphs, was **2022**. In **75%** of their year there was a negative difference from previous terms.
