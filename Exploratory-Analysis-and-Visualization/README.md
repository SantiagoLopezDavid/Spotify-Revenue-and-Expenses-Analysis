# Exploratory Analysis and Visualization

**1. Total Revenue and Total Costs**

<img width="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3f82b7d-6ce0-4d9d-979c-41fe3ddfad3d">


Throughout the years, `Total Costs` and `Total Revenue` have been very close. At the end of the year 2017, `Total Revenue` had a substancial difference from `Total Costs`, and although this means bigger `Gross Profits` for **Spotify** they could not maintain that difference. In the years **2020** and **2022**, `Total Costs` where bigger than `Total Revenue`. The year **2022** would have been the worst in terms of `Gross Profit` due to this big difference.

**2. Total Revenue, Total Costs and Gross Profit**

<img width="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7dcff88d-47fc-46eb-ade7-505eff54c75f">

`Gross Profit` has been increasing during the past 7 years. But although this shows 'growth', `Net profit` would be more representative measure of how well **Spotify** is doing.

**3. Net Profit**

It is clear that `Net Profit` is not a steady measure. It has a lot of drastic changes during the years and is mostly negative with the lowest point at -231 Millions of Euro during the year 2022 and the highest at 213 Millions of Euro during the year 2017. This leaves a lot of questions about the profitability of Spotify as a business. It might seem that `Total Revenue` and `Gross Profit` has a steady growth but so does the `Total Costs` of the company. This behaviour might be the reason why `Net Profit` is not what we expected.

**4. Difference in Net Profit**

This graph shows the difference from every quarter to the previous for all 7 years. It is a very interesting graph because it showcase the fluctation of `Net Profit`. This can help us have a better idea of how is the company behaviour and growth.

As shown in the graphic, we see that the best year in terms of growth was **2017**. Althought they had negative `Net Profit` they still manage to improve in each **Quarter** and finish their **Q4** with the best `Net Profit` of all 7 years. From here is very clear that **Spotify** has a hard time gaining momentum and maintaining improvement from quarter to quarter. There is not a single year from **2017** in which the company has a positive difference in more than two consecutives quarters. The worst year for the company, as we have seen in previous graphs, was **2022**. In **75%** of their year there was a negative difference from previous terms.

**Now lets take a look into **Spotify** two different users groups: Ad-Supported users and Premium Users.**

---
**5. Premium and Ad Revenue**

<img width="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4c95614-19bc-4518-9c61-15a484d82b6a">

`Premium Users` bring a significantly bigger revenue than the `Ad-Supported Users`. `Premium Users` represents **89%** out of the `Total Revenue`, leaving `Ad-Supported Users` only around a **10%** participation.

**6. Ad-Supported Users**

<img width="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf733e62-428c-4dac-b571-20fe8434d7b6">

Ad-Supported Users have very close `Cost of Revenue` and `Revenue` behaviour, which equals to a very 'horizontal' line of `Gross Profit`. Although most of the years the `Gross Profit` its been above the **Zero** line, it is not a significant business for **Spotify**. 

---
**7. Premium Users**

<img width="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0be3baab-a716-4630-8c54-47dac326b421">

**Premium Users** are the business model that brings **Spotify** the most revenue. We can see that in the past 7 years this part of the business is being growing. The gap between the `Revenue` and `Cost of Revenue` its bigger in **2023** than what it was back in **2017**. `Gross Profit` its steady and always above the **Zero** line.

---
**8. Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)**

<img width="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16aa5a6e-c452-49d7-ae77-81b48d7d5816">

The ARPU for Premium users has gone down a little over **1 Euro** over the 7 year period in this analysis. That is **0.19 Euro** per year. Although the ARPU has gone down, the `Revenue` and `Gross Profit` for Premium Users have been growing and this could mean that **Spotify** have been increasing their Premium User base to the point that they can lower their prices to attract even more users. 
In the other hand, a **1 Euro** difference in 7 years is not very significant from the users point of view, so the service is not 'cheaper' than it was before, but the demand for this kind of services its been going up and users are more comfortable with paying subscriptions in order to have their music available at any time.

---
**9. Monthly Active Users**

<img width="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c13b1de7-90b3-4f38-bde7-bf7d63b570e2">

Monthly Users have been growing for the past 7 years, with an increasing difference between Premium Users from Ad-Supported Users in the las 2.5 yeas.
It seems like Ad-supported users will double than Premium Users in some point in the future. Even though **Spotify** has increased their user base, more users are staying in a Ad-Supported version of the App and not making the step over to the Premium plans.

**Comments and Recommendations**

**Comments and Questions**
- It would be interesting to explore the reasons behind the company `Net Profit` behaviour.
  - Is the `Net Profit` numbers normal for a company like **Spotify**?
  - What other data sources could be included in the analysis?

- Was COVID a reason why Costs were higher than Revenue in 2020 for the company?
- 
- How big was the impact on people's music consumption from COVID? 
**Recomendations**
- **Spotify** must find ways to lower their `Total Costs` in order to improve their bottom line `Net Profit`. 



- What happen in 2022 that made costs higher than revenue? spotify business model is based on online/internet based services, not brick and mortar, did covid had a big impact on peoples music consumption behaviour? Would it make more sense if people tended to listen to more music?
- We can se that in between 2020-2022, revenue and costs where going up, maybe spotify was growing and had since people were consuming more music but their cost also went up to keep up with the demand. How is 2022 different and why costs are significantly bigger than revenue?
- What is the convertion rate from ad-supported to premium users? is it worth the expenses to keep the ad-supported part of the business running?
- It might make sense the numbers for ad-supported users since spotify business model is based on making people pay for the premium services. We know that this part of the business makes the most revenue and has better numbers. Would shutting down the ad-supported part of the business have a positve impact on the company costs bottom line? would it improve net-revenue?
- More customers are comfortable with ads and dont change to premium. Why is this? are ads less than before? is people okay with ads? how many minutes per day would a person listen to ads ?
- Recom: Spotify has to increase their ways to make people change to a premium plan. This would increase their revenue in a big way. Would a lower price make people switch? are there any better services? what is the difference on services from spotify to other music services?
