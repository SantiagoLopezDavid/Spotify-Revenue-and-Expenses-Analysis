# Exploratory Analysis and Visualization

**1. Total Revenue and Total Costs**

<img width="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3f82b7d-6ce0-4d9d-979c-41fe3ddfad3d">


Throughout the years, `Total Costs` and `Total Revenue` have been very close. At the end of the year 2017, `Total Revenue` had a substancial difference from `Total Costs`, and although this means bigger `Gross Profits` for **Spotify** they could not maintain that difference. In the years **2020** and **2022**, `Total Costs` where bigger than `Total Revenue`. The year **2022** would have been the worst in terms of `Gross Profit` due to this big difference.

**2. Total Revenue, Total Costs and Gross Profit**

<img width="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7dcff88d-47fc-46eb-ade7-505eff54c75f">

`Gross Profit` has been increasing during the past 7 years. But although this shows 'growth', `Net profit` would be more representative measure of how well **Spotify** is doing.

**3. Net Profit**

It is clear that `Net Profit` is not a steady measure. It has a lot of drastic changes during the years and is mostly negative with the lowest point at -231 Millions of Euro during the year 2022 and the highest at 213 Millions of Euro during the year 2017. This leaves a lot of questions about the profitability of Spotify as a business. It might seem that `Total Revenue` and `Gross Profit` has a steady growth but so does the `Total Costs` of the company. This behaviour might be the reason why `Net Profit` is not what we expected.

**4. Difference in Net Profit**

This graph shows the difference from every quarter to the previous for all 7 years. It is a very interesting graph because it showcase the fluctation of `Net Profit`. This can help us have a better idea of how is the company behaviour and growth.

As shown in the graphic, we see that the best year in terms of growth was **2017**. Althought they had negative `Net Profit` they still manage to improve in each **Quarter** and finish their **Q4** with the best `Net Profit` of all 7 years. From here is very clear that **Spotify** has a hard time gaining momentum and maintaining improvement from quarter to quarter. There is not a single year from **2017** in which the company has a positive difference in more than two consecutives quarters. The worst year for the company, as we have seen in previous graphs, was **2022**. In **75%** of their year there was a negative difference from previous terms.

**Now lets take a look into **Spotify** two different users groups: Ad-Supported users and Premium Users.**

---
**5. Premium and Ad Revenue**

<img width="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4c95614-19bc-4518-9c61-15a484d82b6a">

`Premium Users` bring a significantly bigger revenue than the `Ad-Supported Users`. `Premium Users` represents **89%** out of the `Total Revenue`, leaving `Ad-Supported Users` only around a **10%** participation.


---
**6. Ad-Supported Users**

<img width="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf733e62-428c-4dac-b571-20fe8434d7b6">

Ad-Supported Users have very close `Cost of Revenue` and `Revenue` behaviour, which equals to a very 'horizontal' line of `Gross Profit`. Although most of the years the `Gross Profit` its been above the **Zero** line, it is not a significant business for **Spotify**. 

---
**7. Premium Users**

<img width="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0be3baab-a716-4630-8c54-47dac326b421">

**Premium Users** are the business model that brings **Spotify** the most revenue. We can see that in the past 7 years this part of the business is being growing. The gap between the `Revenue` and `Cost of Revenue` its bigger in **2023** than what it was back in **2017**. `Gross Profit` its steady and always above the **Zero** line.

---
**8. Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)**

<img width="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16aa5a6e-c452-49d7-ae77-81b48d7d5816">

The ARPU for Premium users has gone down a little over **1 Euro** over the 7 year period in this analysis. That is **0.19 Euro** per year. Although the ARPU has gone down, the `Revenue` and `Gross Profit` for Premium Users have been growing and this could mean that **Spotify** have been increasing their Premium User base to the point that they can lower their prices to attract even more users. 
In the other hand, a **1 Euro** difference in 7 years is not very significant from the users point of view, so the service is not 'cheaper' than it was before, but the demand for this kind of services its been going up and users are more comfortable with paying subscriptions in order to have their music available at any time.

---
**9. Monthly Active Users**

<img width="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c13b1de7-90b3-4f38-bde7-bf7d63b570e2">

Monthly Users have been growing for the past 7 years, with an increasing difference between Premium Users from Ad-Supported Users in the las 2.5 yeas.
It seems like Ad-supported users will double than Premium Users in some point in the future. Even though **Spotify** has increased their user base, more users are staying in a Ad-Supported version of the App and not making the step over to the Premium plans.

## Comments and Questions
1. It would be interesting to explore the reasons behind the company `Net Profit` behaviour.
  - Is the `Net Profit` numbers normal for a company like **Spotify**?
  - What other data sources could be included in the analysis?
2. We can see that the company had a growth in Total Revenue and Total Costs. Is this related to COVID? Was the company growing at a pace that after two years in 2022 the costs that the company had were too big and the Revenue was lower than expected?
3. Its not a secret that COVID had a huge impact in companies all over the world and in every industry. It is possible that **Spotify** had a big growth period during the pandemic but after the everything went back to 'normal' users went back to ad-supported plans and stop paying for subscriptions. During this period **Spotify** might have needed to increase their costs due to the high demand from users but once this period was done and users migrate to other companies or decided to cancel subscriptions, **Spotify** was left with higher costs than and a decreasing Revenue.
  - Was COVID a reason why Costs were higher than Revenue in 2020 for the company?
  - What was the impact that COVID had on the company user base?
4. It seems that there are more customers who are comfortable with ads on their app and are not interested in switching to a Premium Plan. It would be interesting to explore the convertion rate from Ad-Supported Users to Premium Users and see if there is a change in the number of users that decide to buy the plan in the past 7-10 years.
  - Would it make sense for **Spotify** to cancel all Ad-Supported plans and just focus on bringing users to their Premium Plans?
  - Is it worth the expenses to keep the Ad-Supporting part of the business running?
  - How are ads times compare in time in the past 7-10 years? Are customer listening to more or less ads? How many minutes per day would a user listen to ads?
  - How does the revenue from ads compare the lowering plans costs to get from Premium Users?
5. Is the price the only thing that is keeping users to move from one plan to the other? If **Spotify** decides to lower prices, what percentage of customers would change plans?
6. Another important aspect to take into account is the fact that **Spotify** is not the only music streaming service platform in the market. Users now days have a bigger pool of options to choose from when it comes to listening to music. Althought we have some numbers from **Spotify** user base, it would be interesting to see what percentage of the market does the company have compare to other competitiors? What is the difference from other music streaming services to **Spotify**? In which areas is **Spotify** better or worst than their competition? How are Premium plans compare to other competitors?

## Recomendations

Based on this data set, and taking into account that the information is very limited, there are two recommendations that can be made:

- **Spotify** must find ways to lower their `Total Costs` in order to improve their bottom line `Net Profit`. They need to be profitable again.
- **Spotify** must find better alternatives to make users change to a Premium plan. This would increase their Revenue and probably their Net Profit.
