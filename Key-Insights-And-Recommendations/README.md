  - Is the `Net Profit` numbers normal for a company like **Spotify**?
  - What other data sources could be included in the analysis?
2. We can see that the company had a growth in Total Revenue and Total Costs. Is this related to COVID? Was the company growing at a pace that after two years in 2022 the costs that the company had were too big and the Revenue was lower than expected?
3. Its not a secret that COVID had a huge impact in companies all over the world and in every industry. It is possible that **Spotify** had a big growth period during the pandemic but after the everything went back to 'normal' users went back to ad-supported plans and stop paying for subscriptions. During this period **Spotify** might have needed to increase their costs due to the high demand from users but once this period was done and users migrate to other companies or decided to cancel subscriptions, **Spotify** was left with higher costs than and a decreasing Revenue.
  - Was COVID a reason why Costs were higher than Revenue in 2020 for the company?
  - What was the impact that COVID had on the company user base?
4. It seems that there are more customers who are comfortable with ads on their app and are not interested in switching to a Premium Plan. It would be interesting to explore the convertion rate from Ad-Supported Users to Premium Users and see if there is a change in the number of users that decide to buy the plan in the past 7-10 years.
  - Would it make sense for **Spotify** to cancel all Ad-Supported plans and just focus on bringing users to their Premium Plans?
  - Is it worth the expenses to keep the Ad-Supporting part of the business running?
  - How are ads times compare in time in the past 7-10 years? Are customer listening to more or less ads? How many minutes per day would a user listen to ads?
  - How does the revenue from ads compare the lowering plans costs to get from Premium Users?
5. Is the price the only thing that is keeping users to move from one plan to the other? If **Spotify** decides to lower prices, what percentage of customers would change plans?
6. Another important aspect to take into account is the fact that **Spotify** is not the only music streaming service platform in the market. Users now days have a bigger pool of options to choose from when it comes to listening to music. Althought we have some numbers from **Spotify** user base, it would be interesting to see what percentage of the market does the company have compare to other competitiors? What is the difference from other music streaming services to **Spotify**? In which areas is **Spotify** better or worst than their competition? How are Premium plans compare to other competitors?

# Recomendations

Based on this data set, and taking into account that the information is very limited, there are two recommendations that can be made:

- **Spotify** must find ways to lower their `Total Costs` in order to improve their bottom line `Net Profit`. They need to be profitable again.
- **Spotify** must find better alternatives to make users change to a Premium plan. This would increase their Revenue and probably their Net Profit.
